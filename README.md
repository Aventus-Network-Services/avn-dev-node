# AvN dev node template


‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT NOTE ‚ö†Ô∏è <br />
This template provides a simple example of how to build a parachain node using Avn pallets and MUST NOT BE USED IN PRODUCTION. It is configured with limited functionality and only contains a subset of avn pallets.

This project template is a modified version of the original
[Substrate parachain Template](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-parachain-template). It has been customized to include the minimum necessary dependencies for integrating some of the AvN pallets into the runtime.

For more details on the implementation of the AvN Dev Node runtime, please refer to the [runtime/README.md](runtime/README.md) file.

## Parachains introduction and tutorials
üëâ Learn more about parachains [here](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-parachains), and

üßô Learn about how to use this template and run your own parachain testnet for it in the
[Devhub Cumulus Tutorial](https://docs.substrate.io/tutorials/v3/cumulus/start-relay/).

## Building the project
*Based on [Polkadot Build Guide](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot#building)*

First [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install):

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
# set default cargo location
source $HOME/.cargo/env
```

If you already have Rust installed, make sure you're using the latest version by running:

```bash
rustup update
```

Once done, finish installing the support software and configure your default toolchain:

```bash
# Install nightly toolchain and use it
rustup toolchain install nightly-2022-10-18
rustup default nightly-2022-10-18
rustup target add --toolchain nightly-2022-10-18 wasm32-unknown-unknown

# Additional OS dependencies
sudo apt install build-essential
sudo apt install --assume-yes git clang curl libssl-dev protobuf-compiler
```

Verify the configuration of your development environment by running the following command:
```bash
rustup show
rustup +nightly show
```
The command displays output similar to the following:
```bash
# rustup show

active toolchain
----------------

stable-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu (default)
rustc 1.62.1 (e092d0b6b 2022-07-16)

# rustup +nightly show

active toolchain
----------------

nightly-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu (overridden by +toolchain on the command line)
rustc 1.65.0-nightly (34a6cae28 2022-08-09)
```
See [here](https://docs.substrate.io/install/linux/) for a more detailed guide on installing Rust and the required dependecies.

Build the client by cloning this repository and running the following commands from the root
directory of the repo:

```bash
git checkout <latest tagged release>
cargo build --release
```


### Building the client

Build the client by cloning this repository and running the following commands from the root
directory of the repo:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

### Building the docker image

Prerequisites:
 - [Install Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) 24.0.2 or newer
 - [Post-installation steps for Linux | Docker Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/)

```sh
# Builds the docker image with the build artefacts under target/release
docker build . --tag aventus/avn-dev-node:latest
```

## Running the node
Once the build process is complete, you can use the binary to run a node and perform other subcommands.

When running a parachain node, you have the option to configure various settings using the command-line interface (CLI). To view a full list of available options, execute the following command:
```
target/release/avn-dev-node -h
```

The simplest way to run a node is as follows:
```bash
target/release/avn-dev-node --dev -- --chain rococo-local
```
After starting the node, you will notice that no blocks are generated. This is because a parachain needs to be onboarded to a relay chain that it is configured with. Substrate provides useful tutorials on how to set up an environment with a relay chain, which is highly recommended to complete. You can find these tutorials [here](https://docs.substrate.io/tutorials/build-a-parachain/).

To expedite the process of local development for this project, we recommend following the [local setup guide](parachain-launch/README.md) to orchestrate a full local network.
